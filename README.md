# Relay Chain Template

Polkadot version v0.9.26
Rust version: 1.64-nightly

### Build from Source

If you'd like to build from source, first install Rust. You may need to add Cargo's bin directory
to your PATH environment variable. Restarting your computer will do this for you automatically.

```bash
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

If you already have Rust installed, make sure you're using the latest version by running:

```bash
rustup update
```

Once done, finish installing the support software:

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential git clang libclang-dev pkg-config libssl-dev
```

Build the client by cloning this repository and running the following commands from the root
directory of the repo:

```bash
./scripts/init.sh
cargo build --release
```

Note that compilation is a memory intensive process. We recommend having 4 GiB of physical RAM or swap available (keep in mind that if a build hits swap it tends to be very slow).


## Hacking on Template

If you'd actually like to hack on Template, you can clone the source code and build it. Ensure you have
Rust and the support software installed. This script will install or update Rust and install the
required dependencies (this may take up to 30 minutes on Mac machines):

```bash
curl https://getsubstrate.io -sSf | bash -s -- --fast
```

Then, grab the Relay Template source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fennsaji/relay-chain-template.git
cd relay-chain-template
```

Then build the code. You will need to build in release mode (`--release`) to start a network. Only
use debug mode for development (faster compile times for development and testing).

```bash
./scripts/init.sh   # Install WebAssembly. Update Rust
cargo build # Builds all native code
```

You can run the tests if you like:

```bash
cargo test --all --release
```

You can start a development chain with:

```bash
cargo run -- --dev
```

Detailed logs may be shown by running the node with the following environment variables set:

```bash
RUST_LOG=debug RUST_BACKTRACE=1 cargo run -- --dev
```

### Development

You can run a simple single-node development "network" on your machine by running:

```bash
.target/release/relay-template --dev
```

You can muck around by heading to <https://polkadot.js.org/apps> and choose "Local Node" from the
Settings menu.

### Local Two-node Testnet

If you want to see the multi-node consensus algorithm in action locally, then you can create a
local testnet. You'll need two terminals open. In one, run:

```bash
.target/release/relay-template --chain=relay-template-local --alice -d /tmp/alice
```

And in the other, run:

```bash
.target/release/relay-template --chain=relay-template-local --bob -d /tmp/bob --port 30334 --bootnodes '/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/30333/p2p/ALICE_BOOTNODE_ID_HERE'
```

Ensure you replace `ALICE_BOOTNODE_ID_HERE` with the node ID from the output of the first terminal.

### Monitoring

[Setup Prometheus and Grafana](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/maintain-guides-how-to-monitor-your-node).

Once you set this up you can take a look at the [Grafana dashboards](grafana/README.md) that we currently maintain.
